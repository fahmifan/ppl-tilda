Why didn't you go to school yesterday?
I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well.
What was your problem?
My stomach was bothering me.
Are you feeling any better?
I'm still feeling a little sick.
I'm going to the store, would you like any Pepto Bismol?
That's okay.
I hope you feel better.
I'd appreciate that.

Hi, can I help you?
Sure, I'd like to book a flight to Iceland.
Your flight has been booked.
Have you thought about what you might like to do this weekend?
I have no idea. Do you have any ideas?
If the weather stays nice, I'd like to go to the beach.
That would be a good choice. The weather has been great for the beach!
Why don't you come with me?
Hey, that would be perfect! What time are you leaving?
I think that Saturday morning around 8:00 would work out well.
Santa Barbara has a music festival on the beach that day. We would have enough time to drop in and see it.
Yes, I knew the festival would be there and was looking forward to going to it.
I am really looking forward to Saturday. Thank you for letting me go with you.

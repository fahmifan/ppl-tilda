It's an ugly day today.
I know. I think it may rain.
It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.
That would be weird.
Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
Yes, it would be. 
I really wish it wasn't so hot every day. 
Me too. I can't wait until winter.
I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
I'd rather be cold than hot.
Me too.
